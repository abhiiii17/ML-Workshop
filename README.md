# ML-Workshop
**COVID Detector**
 project using a machine learning model:

The project aims to create a model to detect COVID-19 using symptoms and medical data.
We will collect data from hospitals and health organizations.
Key features include symptoms like fever and cough.
We will use algorithms like decision trees and neural networks.
The model will be trained on a portion of the data and tested on another.
We will evaluate the model's accuracy and reliability.
A user-friendly interface will allow easy input of data.
We will ensure data privacy and ethical use.
The model can be updated with new information over time.
This project aims to help in early COVID-19 detection and treatment.
